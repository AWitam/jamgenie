# Jam Genie

Jam Genie is a prototype mobile application designed to help guitarists maintain a consistent habit of practicing guitar. It provides a convenient platform for accessing a library of practice routines and individual practice items, as well as interactive learning features.

## Features

-   **Browse Practice Routines**: Explore a library of available practice routines that cover various aspects of guitar playing. Each routine consists of multiple practice items designed to target specific skills or techniques.

-   **Browse Practice Items**: Discover individual practice items that can be added to your custom practice routines. These items focus on specific exercises or drills to improve different aspects of guitar playing.

-   **Home Screen**: Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a welcome screen that provides an overview of the app's features and encourages them to get started with their practice sessions.

-   **Practice Screen**: Engage in an interactive learning mode where the app guides you through each practice item in your selected routine. The app includes a timer that counts down the planned duration for each exercise.

-   **Data Management**: At this stage, all the data in the app is hardcoded. However, the app's architecture follows the MVVM pattern, allowing for future integration with real APIs or local database connectivity.
